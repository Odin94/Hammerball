- use fix ports for every client (eg client 2 has 8123, client 3 has 8134 and so on)


- splattereffect on death (blood particles)
- speed / dmg powerups
- some sort of hitting animation
- active abilities like slow/blink/shield/magnet
- different characters with different abilities/health/dmgpower
- maps changeable with txtfile  (numbers in .txt => tiles) - autodownload map of host (if "mapname.txt" doesnt exist, ask for tcp transmition)
- screenshake whenever the ball hits sth
- stop-frame when ball hits player
- dangerous terrain: slowfields, teleporters, speedways
- minimap
- Geist/ball ist (einzige)lichtquelle


Bugs/Errors:

- ball decelerates unnaturally due to decel being individual for x and y instead of their vector length
- the closer to the ball you are, the less hard you hit (due to the fact that hit-strength is distance(player, ball))

- program crashes when you run it twice and hit "h" on the second instance (no input on 1st)
- program freezes when you run it and press "j" before establishing a server
- If you move the screen during a Mulitplayer session the UDP-packets seem to get delayed (quite heavily)
- multiplayer >2 players: only one hitspampreventor for all players, might cause probs



//slippery tiles code:
